This project is a simple API test automation suite written in C# using RestSharp and NUnit for testing the OpenWeatherMap API. 
The goal is to validate various weather-related endpoints (current and forecast weather by city, country, and coordinates) through automated tests.
Request Builder pattern is used to construct API requests in a clean and reusable way.
